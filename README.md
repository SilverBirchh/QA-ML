# QA Machine Learning Course -  Python OCR

Python Script to read image files and convert them to text using [Google Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/index.html).

Right now it is a CLI interface. 

# Usage as CLI:

`$ python cli.py --image images/walmart.jpg`

You can use the `--preprocess` to apply some limited preprcessing to the image. This options right now are `thresh` to separate the background image from the foreground. And `blur` to reduce noise from the background image.

E.g. `$ python cli.py --image images/walmart.jpg --preprocess blur`

## Installation 

1. You should have a Python environment set up using Python 2.7 or 3.3. If not set up head [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to get it set up.

2. This should also have installed `pip`. Run `pip` in the terminal to see if it did. If it didn't install it you can get it [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).

3. Clone the project and `cd` in to it. 

4. The easy way:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To save new installs:

`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`

The hard way
```
$ pip install pillow
$ pip install pytesseract
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install nltk
```

5. Run the example `python cli.py --image images/walmart.jpg`
